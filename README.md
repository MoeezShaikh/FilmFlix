Built a React application that allows users to search for movies by title using the
Open Movie Database (OMDb) API. The homepage of the application  consist of
a search bar in the middle of the screen where users can type in the title of a movie, and
a list of top 5 search results comes that displays the title, poster, and year
of each movie that matches the search query. Clicking on a movie in the search results
should display a detailed view of the movie, including the plot, director, actors, and
ratings.
